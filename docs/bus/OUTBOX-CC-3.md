T-03 · catalog_ready / On-time click investigation — cannot reproduce live, measured
2026-09-30:
- Backend (dispatch/truck-line/truck-line.routes.ts): reasonsTableExists uses
  `to_regclass('catalogs.load_exception_reasons') IS NOT NULL`, added 2026-09-11
  (fee7a7fdf). to_regclass is catalog metadata, not RLS-gated. Verified live under the
  EXACT scoping withCompanyScope uses (SET LOCAL ROLE ih35_app, no bypass_rls) --
  returns non-null (true) as both neondb_owner and ih35_app.
- The frontend's `catalogReady` (TruckLineBoard.tsx:898) has exactly one consumer
  (:1288) -- an informational banner ("Reason catalog not yet available"). It does not
  disable or gate the On-time node's onClick, which always opens the exception popover
  regardless.
- The actual reasons list the popover shows comes from a SEPARATE endpoint,
  /api/v1/catalogs/load-exception-reasons (load-exception-reasons.routes.ts), which
  hardcodes `catalog_ready: true` (a fixed literal, not a live probe) and queries
  `WHERE operating_company_id = $1 AND is_active = true`.
- Measured live, full scoping (ih35_app role, current_user_id = a real Owner user,
  operating_company_id = USMCA 5c854333-6ea5-4faa-af31-67cb272fef80): count = 11 active
  reasons, matching the 11 the job packet named. No 403 from resolveOperatingCompanyId
  (Owner's org.user_accessible_company_ids() covers every company).
- Backend deployed SHA 7291c8e (built 2026-09-30T14:42:12Z) and frontend deployed build
  15b2636 (built 2026-09-30T15:36:22Z) are both current -- not a stale-deploy issue.
- CONCLUSION: could not reproduce catalog_ready=false or an empty reasons list for the
  Owner role in USMCA with today's deployed code. Either already fixed by an earlier
  commit today (the report predates one of today's many merges) or was transient. If it
  recurs, the next data point that would actually narrow it: the exact role of the user
  who saw it (GRANTLESS-403's known gap is Administrator/Dispatcher/Manager/Safety
  accounts with zero org.user_company_access rows querying a NON-default company --
  Owner is immune to that path) and a browser network-tab capture of the real response
  body, not just the on-screen symptom.

T-21 · geofence mileage engine — measured live 2026-09-30, structural finding confirmed
(reporting before building further, per NOW-CC-3 instruction):
- `materializeRealDrivenMilesSegments` is STILL producing nothing: `telematics.load_
  odometer_segments` is 40 rows, newest created_at 2026-09-29 21:40:25Z (yesterday) --
  with odometer NOW flowing live (300 rows with odometer_mi in the last 2h, newest ping
  2026-09-30 16:20:15Z, confirming T-20's fix is holding). This is the real defect the
  Lead asked me to measure, not assume: odometer is no longer the blocker.
- ROOT CAUSE: 0 of 83 USMCA dispatch-work `mdata.load_stops` rows have `location_id`
  populated (dispatcher-entered pickup/delivery addresses are always free-text, never
  selected from the `mdata.locations` catalog). The materializer's pickup/delivery join
  goes through `load_stops.location_id -> mdata.locations`, so it can structurally never
  match regardless of odometer quality -- only a yard-exit leg (the separate
  `is_ih35_yard` flag path) could theoretically produce a segment today.
- The spine IS alive and current: `geo.geofence_events` 689 rows (newest 16:15:18Z),
  `geo.geofence_state_transitions` 7,615 rows (newest 16:17:09Z) -- this is the real
  foundation T-21's new odometer-capture engine should build on, not the stuck
  load_odometer_segments materializer.
- Per the Lead's own retraction: this is Engine B (verification-only); settlements
  already compute miles from Engine A (`mdata.loads`, MPG=7.287 today). Nothing is
  blocked on this -- proceeding to build the geofence-enter/exit odometer capture
  (SOURCE always labelled, idempotent, guard + freshness alarm) as time allows.
