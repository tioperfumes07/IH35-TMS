# INBOX-DEVIN-A · RETIRED 2026-09-02

Owner removed Devin (usage). **Do not walk. Do not ACK GO-21. Do not POST.**

Live-verify of GO-21 rows is **CC-2**. Unique FINDING overlay is **Cascade**.

If this session is still open: stop. No Book Load. No Cancel walk required.

## ★ MILES LAW FINAL — ALL SEATS — 2026-09-02

**SUPERSEDES #19740.** That bus said pay from practical + empty and forbade short miles. Owner overruled — **STRUCK**. Any INBOX still carrying it is stale.

**PAY LAW — NOT NEGOTIABLE:**
- Driver pay = **SHORT MILES, ALWAYS.** Never practical.
- Customer rate/RPM = **PRACTICAL only** (loaded lane).
- Company cost = **PRACTICAL + EMPTY** (deadhead is real cost).
- Extra miles beyond short = **driver's problem**.
- **NEVER** fold empty into practical.

**MILES-INVERT-01** — catalog short untrustworthy (live: **2,142/3,237** inverted; directional test 352 pairs practical avg gap **29.4** vs short **174.8**). Root cause **NOT swap** — `seed-lane-mileage.mjs` 1:1, `source=History`. **No mass-swap.**

**UX — OWNER:** Autofill practical/short/empty as normal · Flag when untrustworthy · Popup → OK → continue · Operator can edit · **DO NOT BLOCK BOOKING.** Trigger when **short > practical** OR reverse-lane short differs by **> 100 miles**.

**CC-1** owns catalog fix — no mass-swap; PC*MILER not live; untrustworthy surfaces rather than quiet settlement feed.

**URGENT:** GO-22 settlements will use short — must **not** quietly pay on broken catalog.

## ⚡ FAST-MERGE + DEPLOY (ALL SEATS · OWNER 2026-09-02)

**Loop (~4–5 min):** `node scripts/money-pr-local-gate.mjs` (Cursor: `node scripts/cursor-ship-preflight.mjs --body-file …`) → **exit 0 FIRST** (that is merge proof) → `git push` → `gh pr create` → **immediately** `gh pr merge N --squash --delete-branch --admin`. **NEVER** `gh pr checks --watch`. **NEVER** ask Jorge to merge. **NEVER** idle after merge. `git push --no-verify` **only AFTER gate PASS** and **only** for ENV-VERIFY-STATIC class — **never** for your own red guard.

**Deploy:** batch every **5–10** merges; never per-merge prod deploy; CC seats **never** `trigger_deploy`; Cursor lead batches.

**Law:** USMCA only · Never POST Book Load · Never seat financial fixtures · Cursor PR titles **`Cursor-`** prefix.
